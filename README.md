# Kanban Dashboard Application

When a user clicks the "display" button and selects a grouping option, the Kanban board should dynamically adjust to reflect the user's choice.

The application should offer three distinct ways to group the data:

1. **By Status**: Group tickets based on their current status.
2. **By User**: Arrange tickets according to the assigned user.
3. **By Priority**: Group tickets based on their priority level.

Users should also be able to sort the displayed tickets in two ways:

1. **Priority**: Arrange tickets in descending order of priority.
2. **Title**: Sort tickets in ascending order based on their title.


## Steps to Reproduce

1. Clone the repository `git clone https://github.com/mohit-iitbh/KanbanDashboard`
2. Change the current directory`cd KanbanDashboard`
3. Install the node packages `npm i`
4. Create a .env file with `REACT_APP_TICKET_URL = https://api.quicksell.co/v1/internal/frontend-assignment`
5. Start the development Server `npm start`
